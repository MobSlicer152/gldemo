you should to read the files in this order:

main.c
stuff.h
win32.c
misc.c
gl.c

in order to get information about win32, wgl, and opengl functions, google them
like this to get the docs for them:
"win32 <function name>", you want the results from docs.microsoft.com
"win32 <wgl function name>", same as above
"opengl <function name>", khronos.org or docs.gl are good for these
