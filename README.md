## opengl demo

[screenshot](screenshot.png)

you should to read the files in this order:

- `CMakeLists.txt`
- `main.c`
- `stuff.h`
- `win32.c`
- `misc.c`
- `opengl.c`
- `vertex.glsl`
- `fragment.glsl`
- `main.c`` (read it again with all the context of the other files)

### other resources

in order to get information about win32, wgl, and opengl functions, google them
like this to get the docs for them:
"win32 <function name>", you want the results from docs.microsoft.com
"win32 <wgl function name>", same as above
"opengl <function name>", khronos.org or docs.gl are good for these

to properly understand opengl, learnopengl.com explains most of this much better than i can.
